[![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.0.2-blue.svg)](https://github.com/dylanisaiahp/localdex)
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)](LICENSE)
[![Built with Rust](https://img.shields.io/badge/built%20with-Rust-orange.svg)](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

## ✨ Features

- **Blazing fast** — parallel multi-threaded directory traversal using the `ignore` crate
- **Flexible search** — substring pattern matching (AhoCorasick), exact extension filtering, or count all files
- **Cross-platform** — Windows, Linux, and macOS with OS-specific flags handled automatically
- **Smart output** — color-coded results, comma-formatted numbers, optional stats
- **Config-driven** — all flags defined in `config.toml` next to the binary, auto-generated on first run
- **Pipeline-friendly** — exit code `0` on match, `1` on no match (like `grep`)
- **Launch files** — open or launch any found file directly from the terminal
- **Multi-drive scanning** — scan all drives at once with per-drive breakdown *(Windows)*

---

## 📦 Installation

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dylanisaiahp/localdex
cd localdex
cargo build --release
```

The binary will be at `target/release/localdex` (or `localdex.exe` on Windows).

### Windows quick setup

Copy `localdex.exe` to a folder in your PATH (e.g. `C:\Tools\`) and optionally alias it:

```powershell
copy C:\Tools\localdex.exe C:\Tools\ldx.exe
```

On first run, `config.toml` will be auto-generated next to the binary.

---

## 🚀 Usage

```
ldx [pattern] [options]
```

### Examples

```powershell
# Find files containing "invoice" in the name
ldx invoice

# Find all .pdf files quietly (just the count)
ldx -e pdf -q

# Find .rs files in a specific directory
ldx -e rs -d D:\Development

# Count every file on C:\
ldx -a -d C:

# Count every file on all drives with stats
ldx -A -a -S

# Find and launch a game executable
ldx vintagestory.exe --open -1

# Stop after the first 5 matches
ldx -e log -L 5

# Use 8 threads for optimal performance
ldx -a -S -t 8
```

## 🏁 Flags

| Flag | Long | Description | OS |
|------|------|-------------|-----|
| `-a` | `--all-files` | Count all files, no filter needed | All |
| `-A` | `--all-drives` | Scan all drives with per-drive breakdown and total | Windows |
| `-d` | `--dir` | Directory to search (default: current) | All |
| `-e` | `--extension` | Search by file extension (e.g. `pdf`, `rs`) | All |
| `-1` | `--first` | Stop after the first match | All |
| `-h` | `--help` | Show help message | All |
| `-L` | `--limit` | Stop after N matches (e.g. `-L 5`) | All |
| `-o` | `--open` | Open or launch the matched file | All |
| `-q` | `--quiet` | Suppress per-file output; still prints summary | All |
| `-s` | `--case-sensitive` | Case-sensitive search | All |
| `-S` | `--stats` | Show scan statistics | All |
| `-t` | `--threads` | Number of threads to use (default: all available) | All |
| `-v` | `--verbose` | Show detailed scan breakdown (files + dirs separately) | All |

> **Tip:** `-e pdf` matches only `.pdf` files. `"pdf"` as a pattern matches anything with `pdf` in the filename (e.g. `Windows.Data.Pdf.dll`). Use `-e` when you want actual files of that type.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

On first run, `config.toml` is automatically created next to the binary. This file defines all flags and their descriptions — the help text is generated directly from it.

```toml
# ldx configuration file
# Edit this file to customise flags and behaviour
#
# os values: "all", "windows", "linux", "macos"

[flags.all-files]
short = "a"
long = "all-files"
description = "Count all files, no filter needed"
os = "all"
```

You can edit descriptions, and future versions will support user-defined aliases and scripting.

### 🧵 Thread Scaling — `D:\` (37k entries, SSD)

| Threads | Warm Avg | Warm Median | Cold Avg | Cold Median |
|---------|----------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | 153,285/s | 155,817/s | 156,267/s | 162,360/s |

| **16** | **749,385/s** | **744,496/s** | **815,817/s** | **817,494/s** ✅ |

> **Sweet spot: 16 threads** on the smaller data drive. Consistent with the pattern — smaller datasets benefit from more threads.

---

### 💡 Thread Scaling Summary

The sweet spot depends on how many files you're scanning:

| Dataset Size | Recommended Threads |
|---|---|
| < 100k entries | 16 (more = better) |
| 100k – 500k entries | 10–12 |
| 500k+ entries | 10 |

> Use `-t` to benchmark your own system — results vary by CPU, drive speed, and dataset size!

---

### 🌡️ Cold vs Warm Cache

> Cold = first run after reboot. Warm = OS has cached directory metadata in RAM.

| Directory | Entries | Cold (10t) | Warm (10t) | Speedup |
|-----------|---------|------------|------------|---------|
| `C:\` | 945k | 518,317/s | 526,404/s | ~1x |
| `C:\Users\dylan` | 520k | 743,145/s | 731,840/s | ~1x |
| `C:\Program Files` | 86k | 1,372,124/s | 1,336,502/s | ~1x |
| `D:\` | 37k | 707,140/s | 675,445/s | ~1x |

> On SSD, cold and warm cache performance is nearly identical — the OS caches SSD metadata so efficiently that even "cold" scans are fast. This is very different from HDD behaviour where cold cache can be 100x+ slower.

---

### 🏎️ Peak Results

| Scan | Entries | Speed |
|------|---------|-------|
| `C:\Program Files` cold, 16t | 86k | **1,641,700/s** 🏆 |
| `C:\Program Files` warm, 16t | 86k | 1,618,843/s |
| `C:\Users\dylan` cold, 10t | 520k | 743,145/s |
| `C:\` warm, 10t | 945k | 526,404/s |
| `D:\` cold, 16t | 37k | 815,817/s |

---

### 🖴 HDD Benchmarks

> HDD benchmarks were performed on a nearly empty external drive and are not representative of real-world usage. A full, fragmented HDD will perform significantly slower on cold cache scans.
> 
> **If you have a full HDD, please run the included `benchmark.ps1` and share your results by opening an issue — contributions welcome!**

---

### 🐧 Linux / macOS Benchmarks

*Coming soon — contributions welcome! If you run ldx on Linux or macOS, please open an issue with your benchmark results.*

---

## 🔧 Build Script (Windows)

A `build.ps1` script is included for quick build and deploy:

```powershell
.\build.ps1
```

This builds in release mode, copies the binary to `C:\Tools\`, creates the `ldx.exe` alias, and copies `config.toml`.

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap

### v0.0.3
- Split into multiple source files
- Config-based scripting and user-defined aliases
- `-g/--goto` — navigate to matched file's directory
- Comma number formatting improvements

### Future
- `GSX` — companion tool for game discovery (Steam, Epic, standalone)
- Install script with automatic PATH setup
- Linux/macOS benchmarks
