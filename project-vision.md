# Project Vision: parex / prx / parallax

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-18  
**Current Version:** v0.0.8 (localdex, pre-rename) — in progress

---

## Core Mission
Build a blazing-fast parallel search framework (parex) with clean CLI (prx) and Spotlight-style GUI (parallax) wrappers. This is NOT about beating competitors—it's about creating perfectly tailored tools with complete control, config-driven everything, and benchmark-obsessed performance tuning.

---

## The Suite

### parex (the engine)
- **What:** Pure Rust parallel search framework, generic and embeddable
- **Not just files:** Can search anything traversable (posts, products, DB records, file systems)
- **Zero opinions:** No file-system logic in core—that's for wrappers
- **API design:** Simple Query struct in, Results out (zero overhead)
- **Launch:** v0.5.0 on crates.io after separation

### prx (CLI)
- **What:** File search wrapper around parex
- **Binary name:** `ldx` (transitional), then `prx`
- **Note:** No crate conflict on crates.io, but a CLI called PROJAX uses the `prx` command — verify before final rename or keep `ldx` as the permanent binary name
- **Philosophy:** Config-driven everything, zero hardcoded behavior
- **Launch:** v0.5.0 after rename from localdex

### parallax (GUI)
- **What:** Spotlight/Raycast style desktop app (Tauri + Rust)
- **UX:** Borderless, dynamic height, real-time streaming results (NO loading spinners)
- **UX note:** Consider a ~50ms debounce/throttle on first keystrokes when cold to avoid flicker on slow drives
- **Scope:** $HOME by default (not full drives—speed over completeness)
- **Plugins:** 5-tier system (CSS themes → Lua → JS → Python/compiled → Rust)
- **Launch:** After parex/prx stable

### parafetch (future)
- **What:** neofetch/fastfetch alternative using parex for file counts
- **Unique angle:** Real-time scan stats, not static counts

### Enscribe (distant future)
- **What:** Cross-platform notes app for scripture/prayers/journaling
- **Status:** Standalone passion project, optional Parallax integration (keep optional)

## Name Changes (Pending Engine Separation)

**Why rename?** "localdex" no longer fits—it's not just local files anymore.

- **parex** = parallel executor/explorer (available on crates.io ✓)
- **prx** = CLI wrapper (short, punchy) — verify no `prx` command conflict first
- **parallax** = GUI (sleek, visual metaphor for depth perception)

**Timing:** Rename during engine separation milestone, not before.

---

## Version Scheme

```
0.0.X  → experimental (wild iteration)
0.X.X  → beta (code polish, separation prep, GUI design)
r1.0   → stable release (battle-tested)
r1.X   → refinements
r2.0   → major leap (breakthroughs in speed/features)
```

The `r` prefix signals "production-ready." Year-based versioning was considered but rejected—too complex for minimal benefit.

---

## Current State (v0.0.8)

**Performance:**
- Peak: 1,641,700 entries/s @ 16t on 86k files
- Sustained: 526,404 entries/s @ 10t on 945k files (C:\ drive)
- 4.8x faster on Linux VM vs Windows (pending CachyOS bare metal benchmarks)

**Features:**
- Config-driven flag parsing (users can remap any flag)
- Aliases (e.g., `repo = "localdex -D -d D: -1 -S -w -q"`)
- Custom flags (e.g., `-P` → auto-expand to `-e pdf`)
- Management flags: `--config`, `--edit`, `--exclude`, `--check`, `--sync`, `--reset`
- Dynamic `--help` showing user's aliases and custom flags
- Version sourced from `Cargo.toml` via `env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION")`
- `-L` limit race condition fixed (clamped reported count, early-exit guard)
- Cross-platform installer/uninstaller with source cleanup options
- Modular codebase: config.rs, flags.rs, search.rs, display.rs, launcher.rs, main.rs

**What works:**
- File and directory search with substring/extension matching
- Multi-drive scanning (Windows)
- Thread scaling with auto-cap at logical cores
- Real-time result streaming with `-1`/`-L` limits
- `-w/--where` with cd hints
- `-o/--open` with picker for multiple results
- `--check` validates config, catches duplicate flags and missing targets
- `--sync` adds missing default flags without touching user aliases/custom flags
- `--reset` restores default flags, preserves `[aliases]`, `[custom]`, `[meta]`

---

## Key Design Decisions

### Why Rust?
Speed, safety, embeddability. Perfect for both CLI and native library for Tauri/mobile.

### Why NOT indexing/MFT?
Real-time search fits the "instant discovery" UX better than stale indexes. Parallax searches on every keystroke—no waiting.

### Why config.toml over hardcoded flags?
Full user control. Want `-a` to mean something else? Change it. Want `pdf` as an alias? Add it. The binary is just a config executor.

### Why drop pico_args?
Smaller binary, zero parsing overhead, full control over dynamic flag names from config.

### Why separate parex from prx?
- Third parties can embed parex for non-file use cases (e.g., X searching millions of posts)
- Clean API surface, no file-system assumptions in core
- GUI and CLI share one engine, no duplicate logic

### Why Tauri over Electron?
Smaller binaries, native performance, Rust backend integration. No bloated Chromium runtime.

### Why NOT Lua-only plugins?
Accessibility. CSS themes need zero code. Python/JS covers most devs. Rust for power users. Tiered system = broader adoption.

## Roadmap

### v0.0.7 ✓ Shipped
- `--check` (validate config, print summary)
- `--sync` (merge new default flags without overwriting user customizations)
- `--reset` (factory reset config, preserve aliases/custom)
- Dynamic `--help` showing user's aliases/custom flags
- Nicer help layout (Management section, Tips, column-aligned flags)
- `-L` limit race condition fix
- Version from `env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION")`

### v0.0.8 ✓ Shipped (Docs & Testing Polish)
- README.md updated to v0.0.7 feature set ✓
- Windows flag test pass — all flags and aliases verified ✓
- `cargo clippy` + `cargo fmt` clean ✓
- `bump.sh` version helper script ✓
- Scripts moved to `scripts/` directory ✓
- Linux test pass — deferred to v0.1.0 backlog (no Linux machine available)

### v0.1.0 Beta (Next — Pre-Separation)
- Code audit: cut bloat, improve clarity
  - `flags.rs` — simplify parse_args, reduce duplication
  - `main.rs` — extract shared single/multi-drive scan logic
  - `search.rs` — consolidate duplicate match+limit blocks into shared helper
  - `config.rs`, `display.rs` — already clean, minor polish only
- Unit tests for core edge cases (flag conflicts, alias expansion, limit behavior)
- Linux bare-metal benchmarks (CachyOS) — carried from v0.0.8 backlog
- `cargo clippy` zero warnings maintained throughout
- Full cross-platform flag test pass (Windows + Linux)

### Engine Separation Milestone
1. Create `parex` repo → extract core, design Query API
2. Publish `parex` v0.5.0 to crates.io
3. Create `prx` repo → rename localdex, gut engine, depend on `parex` crate
4. Test, publish `prx` v0.5.0
5. Flag architecture refactor (grouped modules: output.rs, search.rs, navigation.rs)

### Parallax Development
1. Tauri setup, borderless window prototype
2. Real-time search integration with parex
3. Settings panel (threads, scope, theme)
4. Plugin system groundwork (Tier 1: CSS themes)
5. Auto-benchmark on first launch → persist optimal config
6. Progressive plugin tiers (Lua → JS → Python → Rust)
7. Theme marketplace (GitHub repo, community submissions)

---

## Plugin System Architecture

### Tier 1 — Themes (CSS/JSON)
- Zero code, just config files
- Catppuccin, Nord, Dracula, Tokyo Night, Gruvbox
- Drop in `~/.config/parallax/themes/`

### Tier 2 — Lightweight Scripts (Lua)
- Simple data enrichment
- CLI command triggers (`!`, `:`, `>`, `?`)
- ~200KB runtime, super fast

### Tier 3 — Web Dev Friendly (JS/TS via Deno)
- Familiar to most devs
- Moderate complexity plugins

### Tier 4 — Power Integrations (Python/Go/C#/Java via WASM or native)
- External API calls (Steam, VirusTotal)
- Heavy processing

### Tier 5 — Full System Access (Rust)
- Replace backend parex if desired
- Deepest API access
- Experienced devs only

**Plugin priorities:** Weighting system so heavy plugins (VirusTotal scan) don't block light ones (theme preview). UI shows "heavy plugin active" badge during execution.

---

## Non-Goals

- **No pre-indexing:** Real-time > stale indexes
- **No MFT reading on Windows:** Parallel traversal is fast enough, simpler code
- **No website (initially):** GitHub handles docs/downloads for free
- **No marketing:** Let quality speak. If it's good, people will find it.
- **Not trying to beat neofetch/ripgrep/fd/fzf:** This is for personal use first. Others benefit if they want.

---

## Why NOT X?

### GSX/ASX specialized tools?
Unnecessary. parex already does universal parallel search. One tool, any data source.

### `--goto` flag?
Shell limitation. Child process can't `cd` the parent. Use `-w/--where` + manual cd instead.

### Year-based versioning (v26.X)?
Too complex, minimal benefit. Clean semantic versioning is simpler and familiar.

---

## Mobile Vision (Distant Future)

- **Enscribe mobile:** Cross-platform notes app companion
- **File browser:** parex-powered Android/iOS file search
- **Technology:** React Native or Flutter with parex compiled as native library

Not a priority until parex/prx/parallax/parafetch are stable.

---

## Community Adoption

**Current traction (14 days, pre-marketing):**
- 54 clones, 37 unique users
- 8 views, 5 unique visitors

Solid for v0.0.X experimental with zero promotion. Post to r/rust after r1.0 stable.

---

## Current Challenges

- **Testing rigor:** Need comprehensive flag testing before each release (v0.0.5 shipped with broken `--help`, v0.0.7 caught `-L` race condition in testing)
- **Documentation debt:** Need parex API docs, plugin dev guides, theme creation tutorials
- **prx name conflict:** Verify PROJAX's `prx` command collision before final rename

---

## Session Notes

**What works amazingly (v0.0.7):**
- All three management commands (`--check`, `--sync`, `--reset`) tested and working
- `--sync` duplicate-key bug caught and fixed in testing (key-name check added)
- `-L` limit race condition identified and fixed before shipping
- Dynamic `--help` showing aliases cleanly
- `env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION")` — Cargo.toml is now single source of truth for version

**Completed in v0.0.8:**
- README, vision, and scripts all updated
- `bump.sh` built, tested, and working
- Windows flag test pass clean
- Scripts moved to `scripts/` directory
- Linux test pass deferred to v0.1.0 (no machine available)

**Next session priorities (v0.1.0 Beta):**
1. Code audit — start with `flags.rs` and `main.rs`
2. Extract shared scan logic from `main.rs` all-drives duplication
3. Unit tests — flag conflict validation, alias expansion, limit clamping
4. Linux bare-metal benchmarks when CachyOS machine available
5. Begin engine separation planning (parex Query API design)

---

**End Vision:** A suite of tools so fast, so clean, so configurable that they become daily drivers—not because they beat the competition, but because they're exactly what we need.
